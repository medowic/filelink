<p align="center"><strong>Fast data transfer and secure access in your browser</strong></p>

# What is it?
<h1 align="center">
  <img src="/github/demo_success.png" alt="Demo" width="1000">
</h1>
<p align="center">Share your folder with files with self-hosted server, locally or worldwide just in browser</p>

# Why Filelink?
- **Self-hosted**: run it right on your PC
- **Easy to use**: [4 steps](#how-to-use) to get access to the files
- **Lightweight**: less than `512 KB` - you can take it anywhere!
- **Cross-platform**: Windows or Linux
- **Secure**: nobody can get access without a passkey
- **No limits**: share and download as many files as you want

# How to use?
### As client (user):
1. Open the link where Filelink is hosted in your browser
2. Click to `show files` button
3. Enter the passkey that you received from host
4. Get access to the folder and start downloading!

> [!TIP]
> Also, you can use the `?passkey=` key in link for direct access to the folder

For example:
```
http://localhost:8080/access?passkey=enter-passkey
```
*where* `enter-passkey` *is your passkey*
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Get direct access may be only on `/access` page

### As server (host):
1. Locate your files into `files` directory where Filelink is located
2. [Install](#installation) and [run](#start) Filelink server
3. Share passkey with users

# Installation
### Requirements:
- `python3` with `pip3`
> [!NOTE]
> Also, this project based on `Flask` and `Waitress`
## Windows
1. Download source code or use `git`
```
git clone https://github.com/medowic/filelink.git
```
2. Open the terminal in the folder where Filelink is located and make the `requirements.txt` file with all dependencies
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
3. Install it from `requirements.txt`
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> [!TIP]
> Also, you can use the `setup.cmd`, located in the same directory, for automatic installation
> 
> **It makes the same things**

## Linux
1. Clone repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/medowic/filelink.git
```
2. Open the terminal in the folder where Filelink is located and make the `requirements.txt` file with all dependencies
```sh
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
3.1. Install it from `requirements.txt`
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> For global-wide install, use `--break-system-packages`
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
```
3.2. Also, on some Debian-based systems with `apt`, Flask can't be installed using `pip3`

To install it, use `apt`
```sh
apt install python3-flask
```
> [!TIP]
> Also, you can use the `setup.sh`, located in the same directory, for automatic installation
> 
> **It makes the same things**
```sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
For global-wide install of dependencies, use `--break-system-packages`:
```sh
./setup.sh --break-system-packages
```

# Start
In the parent directory, find the `run.py` file and run it
## Windows
```
python run.py
```
> [!TIP]
> Also, in the same directory, you can find the `start.cmd` file for quick running in a separate window
## Linux
```sh
python3 run.py
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the server will start at `0.0.0.0:8080`

### Set folder for file sharing
In any system you can set the file sharing path in the first argument
```
./run.py /path/to/files
```

# Configuration
In `config/config.yaml`, you can change some settings
## Server
### Address

```yaml
server:
  address: 0.0.0.0 # all addresses
```
### Port
Set port:
```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
```
## Custom
There you can set some user parameters

If the `custom` parameter is not set, all these settings are will be created automatically or generated by Filelink
### Passkey

```yaml
custom:
  passkey: some-passkey
```
### Username
Set the username, which will be indicated in the line `Hosted by:` on website. If not specified, the auto-generated string will contain the username from your machine
```yaml
custom:
  username: filelink-user
